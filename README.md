# AnglicanDailyReading

This repo was created specifically to create a Anglican Daily Reading plan service that can be used by the SubSplash Mobile App solution.
That said, it could easily be modified to create and return any custom reading plan to the same SubSplash reading plan solution.

The service outputs in <xml> in the following format to meet the SubSplash specified requirements:
<plan>
<title></title>
<reading>
<day></day>
<passage></passage>
...
</reading>
...
</plan>

This service was created using .NET Core 6.0 and is set to publish to an IIS server, but it could just as easily be set to deploy to a container and hosted on any cloud-based service.

In Service to our Savior Jesus Chirst who is seated at the right hand of the Father,
